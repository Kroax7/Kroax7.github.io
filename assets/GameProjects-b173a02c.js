        My role was a <strong>technical designer</strong> who worked on the project from it's earliest days with proof of 
        concept up until a standalone demo and finally release. 
        <br/>By the end of the project I also transitioned into acting <strong>Design Team Lead</strong> where I oversaw 
        delegation of tasks and project planning as well as spearheaded a performance task force ahead of launch.

        Being the sole technical designer at the start of the project meant I had to wear many hats during development but
         also held a unique insight into the project and it's systems as I had laid the groundwork for much of it. 
         <br/>As the team grew larger I handed of more tasks to other team members and focused more on combat, player 
         character and The Dark Man.
